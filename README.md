### 📊 Programmatic Usage

### Example Queries

```python
# Using the enhanced function with confidence scores
answer, sources = answer_query_enhanced(
    "What are the main legal challenges regarding AI in justice?", 
    top_k=4
)

# Example output with confidence:
# Answer: [Detailed legal analysis...]
# 
# 🟢 Confidence: 87%
# 
# Sources:
#   1. 🟢 Responsible-AI.pdf (Chunk 106) - Confidence: 92%
#   2. 🟡 AI_and_India_Justice.pdf (Chunk 11) - Confidence: 85%
#   3. 🟡 legal3.pdf (Chunk 16) - Confidence: 78%
```

### 🛠️ Utility Functions

```python
# View recent query history
view_chat_history(n=5)

# Export all results to a file
export_results("my_legal_research.txt")

# Compare two different queries
compare_queries(
    "What are AI challenges in law?",
    "How does AI impact justice?"
)

# Clear cache to free up space
clear_cache()

# View system statistics
show_system_stats()
```

### Sample Output

```
Question: What are the main legal challenges discussed regarding AI and justice?

Answer:
The main legal challenges include ensuring fairness and non-discrimination in AI 
systems used in judicial processes. The Constitution prohibits discrimination based 
on certain markers while also providing for positive discrimination through affirmative 
action.

AI systems must be transparent and explainable to maintain public trust in the 
justice system. There are concerns about algorithmic bias that could perpetuate 
existing inequalities in legal outcomes.
